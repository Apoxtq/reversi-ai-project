# Ensure deleted files are tracked in Git
# Note: When files are deleted, use 'git rm' to stage deletions
# This ensures deleted files are properly tracked in Git history
#
# Important: All documentation files (*.md) are explicitly tracked
# Deleted files should be staged with 'git rm <file>' to preserve deletion history
#
# Files that were cleaned up:
# - compile_week3.bat, build_week3.ps1, build_week4.bat, build_week4.ps1
